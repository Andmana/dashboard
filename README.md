# Dashboard

This project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)'s curriculum. It involves building a dashboard based on a given design.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a dashboard page that closely imitates the design provided in the project specifications, using grid and flexbox as layout design. This project helps to practice HTML and CSS skills, particularly in layout design and styling.

### Project Design
